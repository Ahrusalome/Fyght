## Welcome to our C# Project !


# Explications :

This project was created by three second year students of computer sciences. As part of our C# lessons, our final exam is a project which consists in the making of a video game working with the well-known software unity. 🎮

Our game is a fighter which allows two players to compete against each other. By using either the keyboard or the controller, they can both choose one player to fight with. Obviously, the goal is to beat the other one with the few possibilities of attacks and defense. 🥊  


# Lore : 
It's the chaos in the flatshare. After a tasteful meal, only one spring roll is left. An heated argument results : Paul and Alex must now decide over a showdown which one will inherit it. There can be only one contestant alive... as such as their precious food.
*Who will get the last spring roll ?*


# Commands : 

Two playable characters are selectabled. 
One is using the keyboard while the other is using the controller.
